## Server Requirements
- PHP >= 7.4

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:
```
composer require keyword-extractor/keyword-extractor
```


## Usage

The `KeywordExtractor` provides the following public methods:
- [extract](#usage-of-extract)($text, $sortBy, $sortDir)               # provide extracted keywords with additional information
- [extractKeywordsOnly](#usage-of-extractkeywordsonly)($text, $sortBy, $sortDir)   # provide extracted keywords only

### Usage of extract()

Extracting keywords:
```
$keywordExtractor = new KeywordExtractor();
$text = 'This is a simple sentence.';
$result = $keywordExtractor->extract($text);
```

The result with the default modifiers and no sorting values will be:
```
Array
(
    [simpl] => Array
        (
            [frequency] => 1
            [occurrences] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => simple
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 3
                                )
                        )
                )
        )
    [sentenc] => Array
        (
            [frequency] => 1
            [occurrences] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => sentence.
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 4
                                )
                        )
                )
        )
)
```

Currently, the default modifiers are as follow (they will be applied to the tokens in order):
```
[
    new EmailFilter(),
    new PunctuationFilter(),
    new WhitelistFilter($this->getWhitelist()),
    new BlacklistFilter($this->getBlacklist()),
    new StopWordFilter(),
    new NumberFilter(),
    new StemFilter(),
    // run the blacklist even after stemming too
    new BlacklistFilter($this->getBlacklist()),
]
```

Obviously, you can set your own modifiers:
```
$keywordExtractor->setModifiers([new PunctuationFilter()]);
```

Also, whitelist can be used as follow:
```
$keywordExtractor = new KeywordExtractor();
$text = 'This is a simple sentence and simple sentence.';
$keywordExtractor->setWhitelist(['simple']);
$result = $keywordExtractor->run($text);
```

Which results in:
```
Array
(
    [simple] => Array
        (
            [frequency] => 2
            [occurrences] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => simple
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 3
                                )
                        )
                    [1] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => simple
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 6
                                )
                        )
                )
        )
    [sentenc] => Array
        (
            [frequency] => 2
            [occurrences] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => sentence
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 4
                                )
                        )
                    [1] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => sentence.
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 7
                                )
                        )
                )
        )
)
```

Blacklist can also be used in the same way as whitelist:
```
$keywordExtractor = new KeywordExtractor();
$text = 'This is a simple sentence.';
$keywordExtractor->setBlacklist(['simple']);
$result = $keywordExtractor->run($text);
```

The result is:
```
Array
(
    [sentenc] => Array
        (
            [frequency] => 1
            [occurrences] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => sentence.
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 4
                                )
                        )
                )
        )
)
```

To sort by frequency in descending order:
```
$keywordExtractor->run($text, Sorter::SORT_BY_FREQUENCY, Sorter::SORT_DIR_DESC);
```

To sort by min occurrences distance:
```
$text = 'sentence and sentence';
$result = $this->keywordExtractor->run($text, Sorter::SORT_BY_MIN_OCCURRENCE_DISTANCE);

Array
(
    [sentenc] => Array
        (
            [frequency] => 2
            [occurrences] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => sentence
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 0
                                )
                        )
                    [1] => Array
                        (
                            [ngram] => sentence
                            [indexes] => Array
                                (
                                    [0] => 2
                                )
                        )
                )
            [minOccurrencesDistance] => 1
        )
)
```

### Usage of extractKeywordsOnly()

Extracting keywords only:
```
$keywordExtractor = new KeywordExtractor();
$text = 'This is a simple sentence.';
$result = $keywordExtractor->extractKeywordsOnly($text);
```

The result will be:
```php
array(2) {
  [0]=>
  string(6) "simple"
  [1]=>
  string(8) "sentence"
}
```
